You have a response or error which is = HTTP.get in the func get(), you're passing in some type of base URL or some type of route that you want to hit same in the func get() function. In this case, it's /books.
we then say if the err != nil, meaning we do have an error, we're going to print that out and then return. so we stop with this (func get() function). Otherwise, we're going to come down to (responseData, err := ioutil.ReadAll(response.body)) and read in the response body as a byte object. we're then going to take that byte object and we're going to unmarshal it into the typing go that we want to have this data represented as. So now we have a bunch of book strikes we can use just as a regular go object or go data type.
